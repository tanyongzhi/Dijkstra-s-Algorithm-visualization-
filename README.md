## Graph Algorithm Visualizations
> An web-application to visualize common algorithms on graphs

### Description:
This is a web application for the visualization of varoius graph-based algorithms. As of the latest version, the application includes Dijkstra's Algorithm. There are plans to develop the application for Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms as well.

Hi! I am currently a sophomore major in computer engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I started this project during the winter break of my sophomore year as a process for me to familiarize with the important commonly used graph-based algorithms. Feel free to contact me with any questions/feedback regarding this project. 

### Built from:
 * https://github.com/facebook/react - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
 * https://visjs.org/ - A dynamic, browser based visualization library

### Prepare your environment for developing:
Before we begin, please make sure that you have the following installed:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Running the application:
After cloning the repo, navigate to the project folder. <br/>
Install dependencies:
